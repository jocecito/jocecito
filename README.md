# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jose Centeno
## About me?
Hello! I'm Jose, a passionate full-stack developer with experience in challenging and collaborative projects. My journey began in 2020 when I took the reins of my education and delved into the fascinating world of development through self-learning.
I am currently part of a dedicated team working on a large-scale project for managing IT services and incident tracking. We leverage technologies such as TypeScript, React, Django REST framework, SQL and Tailwind.css.

## Challenges and Achievements
I've faced exciting challenges, from token authentication renewal to the implementation of code internationalization. One notable aspect of my journey has been the creation and enhancement of interfaces using Material UI. I specialize in adapting the components of this library to suit the specific needs of the project, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience. My approach is focused on problem-solving, always keeping SOLID principles as a guide for development.

### Backend:

## Continuous Learning
I stay updated through online communities and connections with people who share relevant news and content. Collaboration and honest communication are essential to me, and I believe in sharing knowledge to strengthen the community.

## Goals
I aspire to be a reference in full-stack development, the go-to person for those seeking creative solutions. My long-term goal is to contribute to the evolution of the community, inspiring others to overcome labor market challenges and grow together. I plan to achieve this through the construction of standout projects and fostering the personal and professional growth of those around me.
